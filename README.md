# Personal Portfolio Website V1

## Here is the link to the website: https://laraibsyed.github.io/

A website that acts as an extenstion to my resume as well as a place to display all my projects. This website is made with HTML and CSS and the design is an inspiration of Brittany Chiangs website, where one part of the screen is static while the other isn't. Here is the link to her website: https://brittanychiang.com/ 

The responsiveness does work however, I am still working on it, so it might look kinda mid on some screens, so apologies for that. I hope to fix the responsiveness soon :)
